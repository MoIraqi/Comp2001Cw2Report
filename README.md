# Trail Microservice


This is a RESTful microservice for managing trails as part of a well-being trail application. The goal of this service is to enhance the outdoor experience by offering users detailed information about walking trails and their associated features, locations, and participants.

Key Features

Trail Management: Create, update, delete, and retrieve trails, including metadata such as difficulty, length, elevation gain, and route type.

User Participation: Track user involvement in specific trails using a TrailUser relationship.

Trail Features: Associate unique features (e.g., viewpoints, rest areas) with trails for enriched details.

Geospatial Points: Manage detailed location points for trails, including latitude, longitude, and descriptions.

Role-Based Access: Enable specific permissions and functionality for users based on their roles (e.g., owners, participants).

Entities and Relationships



The Trail Microservice interacts with several database tables to model the system:

Users: Contains user details like username, email, and role.

Trails: Represents the walking trails with detailed attributes.

TrailUser: Links users to trails they own or participate in.

Features: Represents specific characteristics of trails.

TrailFeature: Links features to trails.
